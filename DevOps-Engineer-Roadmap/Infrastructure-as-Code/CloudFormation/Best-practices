Planning and organizing
Organize your stacks by lifecycle and ownership
Use cross-stack references to export shared resources
Use IAM to control access
Reuse templates to replicate stacks in multiple environments
Verify quotas for all resource types
Use nested stacks to reuse common template patterns

Creating templates
Do not embed credentials in your templates
Use AWS-specific parameter types
Use parameter constraints
Use AWS::CloudFormation::Init to deploy software applications on Amazon EC2 instances
Use the latest helper scripts
Validate templates before using them

Managing stacks
Manage all stack resources through AWS CloudFormation
Create change sets before updating your stacks
Use stack policies
Use AWS CloudTrail to log AWS CloudFormation calls
Use code reviews and revision controls to manage your templates
Update your Amazon EC2 Linux instances regularly
