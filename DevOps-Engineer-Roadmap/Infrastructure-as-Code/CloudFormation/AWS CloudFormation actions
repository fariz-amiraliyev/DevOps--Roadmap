When you create a group or an IAM user in your AWS account,
you can associate an IAM policy with that group or user, which
specifies the permissions that you want to grant. For example, imagine you
have a group of entry-level developers. You can create a Junior application
developers group that includes all entry-level developers. Then, you associate
a policy with that group that allows users to only view AWS CloudFormation stacks.
In this scenario, you might have a policy such as the following sample:

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[{
        "Effect":"Allow",
        "Action":[
            "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
            "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
            "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource",
            "cloudformation:DescribeStackResources"
        ],
        "Resource":"*"
    }]
}
