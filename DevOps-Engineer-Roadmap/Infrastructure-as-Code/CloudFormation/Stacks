AWS CloudFormation manage related resources as a single unit called a stack.
AWS CloudFormation create, update, and delete a collection of resources
by creating, updating, and deleting stacks.

All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template.
When creating a template that includes an Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing load
balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database
instance. To create those resources, you create a stack by submitting the
template that you created, and AWS CloudFormation provisions all those resources
for you. You can work with stacks by using the AWS CloudFormation console,
API, or AWS CLI.
