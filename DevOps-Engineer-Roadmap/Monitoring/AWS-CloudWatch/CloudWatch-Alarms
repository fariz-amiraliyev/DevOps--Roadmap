CloudWatch alarms are used to automatically initiate actions on behalf.
 An alarm watches a single metric over a specified timeframe and performs one or
 more specified actions, based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold
 over time. The action is a notification sent to an SNS topic or an Auto
 Scaling policy.
