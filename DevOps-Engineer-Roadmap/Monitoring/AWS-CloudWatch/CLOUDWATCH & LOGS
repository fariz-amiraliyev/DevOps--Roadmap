Amazon CloudWatch provides robust monitoring of our entire AWS infrastructure,
including EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3, ELB, and other AWS resources.

We will be able to track a wide variety of helpful metrics, including CPU usage,
network traffic, available storage space, memory, and performance counters.

1. Note that Amazon CloudWatch does not aggregate data across regions.
   metrics are completely separate between regions. Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository.

2. We can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access our log files
  from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail,
  and other sources. We can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs.


3. Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time.
   Monitor AWS CloudTrail Logged Events.
   Archive Log Data.

4. Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time:

  CloudWatch Logs can consume logs from resources in any region, but we can only view
  the log data in the CloudWatch console in the regions where CloudWatch Logs is supported.

5. Install and Configure the CloudWatch Logs Agent on a Running EC2 Instance
$ cd /tmp
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com//aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py -O
$ sudo apt install python
  sudo python ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region us-east-1

6. Create a Log Group in CloudWatch Logs

7. Exporting Log Data to S3
8. Accessing CloudWatch Logs for Lambda
AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions for us, reporting metrics
through Amazon CloudWatch. To help us troubleshoot failures in a function,
Lambda logs all requests handled by our function and also automatically stores
logs generated by our code through Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
