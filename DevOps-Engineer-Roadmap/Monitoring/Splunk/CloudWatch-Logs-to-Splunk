Splunk supports numerous ways to get data in, from monitoring local files or streaming wire data,
to pulling data from remote 3rd-party APIs, to receiving data over syslog, tcp/udp, or http.

One example of pulling data from remote sources is the widely popular Splunk Add-on for AWS which
reliably collects data from various AWS services.
One example of pushing data is via AWS Lambda function which is used to stream events over HTTPS
to Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

These two pull and push models apply to different use cases and have different considerations.
This post pertains to the push model which is particularly applicable for microservice architectures
and event-driven computing such as AWS Lambda. Since there are no dedicated pollers to manage and
orchestrate, the ‘push’ model generally offers the following benefits:

Lower operational complexity & costs
Easier to scale
Low friction
Low latency


Step-by-step walkthrough to stream AWS CloudWatch Logs
Step 1: Enable CloudWatch Logs stream
Step 2: Configure Splunk HEC input
Step 3: Configure Lambda function


2. Configure Splunk HEC input
Now that you have flow logs being recorded, we’ll start setting up the data pipeline from the end,
that is Splunk, working our way backward.

2a. Install Splunk Add-on for AWS. Note that since we’ll be using Splunk HEC,
we will *not* be relying on any modular input from the Add-on to collect from
CloudWatch Logs or VPC Flow Logs. However, we will leverage the data parsing logic
(i.e. sourcetypes) that already exist in the Add-on to automatically parse the VPC
Flow logs records and extract the fields.

2b. Create an HEC token from Splunk Enterprise. Refer to Splunk HEC docs for detailed instructions.
When configuring the input settings, make sure to specify “aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow” as sourcetype.
This is important to enable automatic fields extractions. Make sure to take note of your new HEC token value.
Note: For Splunk Cloud deployments, HEC must be enabled by Splunk Support.
