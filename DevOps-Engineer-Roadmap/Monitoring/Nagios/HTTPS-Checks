From the get-go, we've had errors checking the WebUI on the Core Host. There are a couple of reasons for this:

If you examine the help for the "check_http" plugin, you'll see there isn't an option for checking HTTPS.
We're not passing credentials to the plugin to log in to the WebUI.
The "check_http" plugin throws an error if it encounters anything but an HTTP 200 response (by default â€“ it can be configured otherwise). This wouldn't normally be difficult to configure, but since Apache is ONLY serving the default site over port 80 (which returns a 304 Header), the plugin throws an error.
We have two options here. The first is to "fix" the Apache configuration so that it either serves out content or doesn't listen on Port 80. The second is to remove the HTTP service from the Nagios Core Host.

In the real world, it would be wise to disable Apache's listening on Port 80, since we're not using it. Since this IS a course about Nagios Core, however, we're going do disable the HTTP service.

In the WebUI, look at the service groups.
You'll see that the HTTP check is in our "localhost-services" group.
Because we've maintained a well-organized configuration, this makes it easy to determine the location of the service definition.
Find the file in which the service is defined, and remove the HTTP service.
Verify your configuration.
Re-check the WebUI to make sure the error has been resolved. (Hint: it should just "disappear" at the next check.)


We've maintained a well-organized configuration througout the course. Because the HTTP service on the Nagios Core Host is part of the localhost-services service group, we know that the definition for this service will be in the /opt/nagios/etc/object/services/local-services.cfg file.

Deleting the HTTP service definition will remove the HTTP service from the localhost, and keep the error from being generated, since a check against HTTP won't be performed. Once the file is amended, the configuring should be re-checked using /opt/nagios/bin/nagios -v /opt/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg.

That file should look like this:
