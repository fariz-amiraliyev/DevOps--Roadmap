Host and service groups

define hostgroup with cfg file.


Adding Services to Service Groups

Log in to the Nagios Core Host.
Change to the /opt/nagios/etc/objects/servicegroups directory.
Edit the new file: remote-services.cfg
Use the defaults defined in the "linux-server" template
Use "remote-services" for the service group name.
Use "Remote Service Group" for the alias.
Find all of the services running on our remote servers and add them with the
 "members" directive, taking care to pay attention to the pairing of values
 required. Check your configuration, restart Nagios, and view the Servicegroup in the WebUI.
