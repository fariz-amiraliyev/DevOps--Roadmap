In this exercise, we will install the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor on the
Nagios Core Host as well as any remote hosts on which we haven't already
installed it. We must install this software there to install the "check_nrpe"
plugin that we use to perform active checks using the NRPE. Use the latest 3.x
series (3.0.1 was current at the time of writing).

Re-install the dependencies:
yum group mark remove "Development Tools"
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install krb5-devel openssl-devel
Obtain the source code, which can be found at the Nagios Plugin Exchange.
cd ~user
wget https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/archive/nrpe-3.0.1.tar.gz
gunzip nrpe-3.0.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf nrpe-3.0.1.tar.gz
cd nrpe-3.0.1
Configure the source code, compile it, and install it:
./configure --prefix=/opt/nagios --exec-prefix=/opt/nagios --enable-ssl --enable-command-args --enable-bash-command-substitution --with-opsys=linux --with-dist-type=rh --with-init-type=systemd --with-nrpe-user=nagios --with-nrpe-group=nagios --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
make all && make install && make install-config && make install-init
Check to make sure the "check_nrpe" plugin has been placed in "/opt/nagios/libexec." Make sure the file is properly owned and has the appropriate permissoins.
Edit the NRPE configuration file, which should be at /opt/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg, so that it has the following amendments:
allow_weak_random_seed=1
ssl_version=SSLv2+
ssl_client_certs=0
log_facility=daemon
debug=1
pid_file=/opt/nagios/var/nrpe.pid
server_port=5666
listen_queue_size=5
nrpe_user=nagios
nrpe_group=nagios
allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1
dont_blame_nrpe=1
allow_bash_command_substitution=1
command_timeout=60
connection_timeout=300
DO NOT enable the NRPE service. It's not necessary on the Nagios Core Host. On all other hosts, issue the following commands to enable NRPE:
systemctl enable nrpe.service
systemctl start nrpe.service



The "check_nrpe" binary exists in "/opt/nagios/libexec," and the nrpe.cfg file located in "/opt/nagios/etc" has the following values:

allow_weak_random_seed=1
ssl_version=SSLv2+
ssl_client_certs=0
log_facility=daemon
debug=1
pid_file=/opt/nagios/var/nrpe.pid
server_port=5666
listen_queue_size=5
nrpe_user=nagios
nrpe_group=nagios
allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,
dont_blame_nrpe=1
allow_bash_command_substitution=1
command_timeout=60
connection_timeout=300
 Make SURE to include the commands from the study guide at the bottom of the file:

command[check_users]=/opt/nagios/libexec/check_users -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$
command[check_load]=/opt/nagios/libexec/check_load -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$
command[check_disk]=/opt/nagios/libexec/check_disk -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ -p $ARG3$
command[check_procs]=/opt/nagios/libexec/check_procs -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ -s $ARG3$
