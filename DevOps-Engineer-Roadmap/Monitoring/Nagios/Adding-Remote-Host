This exercise entails adding a new Host configuration file and
object for the server on which we've just installed the NRPE.

Log in to the Nagios Core Host.
Change to the /opt/nagios/etc/objects/hosts directory.
Edit the new file: host-mylabserver-com.cfg, where host is
the unqualified hostname of your Linux Academy Lab Server.
Use the defaults defined in the "linux-server" template.
Use the "24x7" time period for the check period.
Set the maximum number of check attempts to 10.
Use the "check_ping" command, with 2000.00 milliseconds and 80% for
 the warning threshold.
Use 5000.00 milliseconds and 100% for the critical threshold.
Make sure the "admins" contact groups is associated with the host.
