Escalations are a specific type of notification sent when problems persist
beyond a specified period of time. Beyond that, they're identical to normal
escalations

Nagios XI checks the objects notification interval to determine
if enough time has past since the last notification was sent.

In the above example using a check interval of 5 minutes, the object needs to
be checked 12 more times (12 x 5 = 60) before the next notification is sent
â€¢ When the next notification is sent, this is determined to be notification #2


What Are Escalations And Why Are They Required
Escalations allow to send notifications based on different criteria.
In the Notification Basics section, the notifications will always be sent to the
contacts defined on the object. Escalations allow you to send the
notifications to different contacts after x amount of notifications have been sent.
Hence you can escalate an
problem from the Help Desk Team to the On Call Team and then to the Department Manager.
Escalations allow you to send notifications to the required people at the right time.
The Department Manager does not want to be notified of a problem initially, they only want to know about
it if the Help Desk Team and the On Call Team have not addressed the issue.

Escalations Take Priority
Escalations will overwrite ANY notification options on the host or service object when they take affect (this
includes the contacts/contactgroups). This is very important to remember when determining who should be
notified. When an escalation no longer takes affect then the notification options on the host or service object
will be used.
