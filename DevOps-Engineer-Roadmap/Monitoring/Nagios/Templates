Nagios provides an exceptionally powerful and simple templating system.


There are host templates and service templates. Host templates
control settings for host objects and service templates control settings
for service objects. Best practice is to set as many of the settings as
possible via templates so changes are centralized later on down the road.

So I define a host template like the following -

define host {
       name                          		HTP-TEMPPROBE
       alias                         		Template for ITWatchdog temp probes
       hostgroups                    		Site_Temperature_Probe
       check_command                 		check_icmp_vpn!!!!!!!!
       max_check_attempts            		3
       check_interval                		15
       retry_interval                		5
       check_period                  		24x7
       event_handler_enabled         		1
       flap_detection_enabled        		1
       process_perf_data             		1
       retain_status_information     		1
       retain_nonstatus_information  		1
       contact_groups                		NOC
}
