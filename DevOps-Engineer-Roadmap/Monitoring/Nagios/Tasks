1. Active Check w/NRPE
Create command and service definitions which mirror the "Local Time Offset"
command and service.
Make sure that this service is configured properly in the NRPE configuration
file of one of your remote hosts. Ensure the local clock time offset is being
monitored by an active check.

Use the check_ntp plugin to build the command on the remote host.
Specify the command in the nrpe.cfg file of th remote host.
Build the service on the Nagios Core host, using the check_nrpe plugin to
remotely execute the command built in step #1.

Command Definition on Nagios Core
define command{
commmand_name           nrpe-clock-offset
command_line            $USER1$/../libexec/check_nrpe -H "$HOSTADDRESS$" -c check_local_time_offset -H 0.us.pool.ntp.org -W 60
}
