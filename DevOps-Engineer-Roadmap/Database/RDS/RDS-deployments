Read replicas, Multi-AZ deployments, and multi-region deployments
Amazon RDS read replicas complement Multi-AZ deployments. While both features
maintain a second copy of your data, there are differences between the two:
Multi-AZ deployments

Multi-Region deployments

Read replicas

Main purpose is high availability

Main purpose is disaster recovery and local performance

Main purpose is scalability

Non-Aurora: synchronous replication; Aurora: asynchronous replication

Asynchronous replication

Asynchronous replication

Non-Aurora: only the primary instance is active; Aurora: all instances are active

All regions are accessible and can be used for reads

All read replicas are accessible and can be used for readscaling

Non-Aurora: automated backups are taken from standby; Aurora: automated backups are taken from shared storage layer

Automated backups can be taken in each region

No backups configured by default

Always span at least two Availability Zones within a single region

Each region can have a Multi-AZ deployment

Can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

Non-Aurora: database engine version upgrades happen on primary; Aurora: all instances are updated together

Non-Aurora: database engine version upgrade is independent in each region; Aurora: all instances are updated together

Non-Aurora: database engine version upgrade is independent from source instance; Aurora: all instances are updated together

Automatic failover to standby (non-Aurora) or read replica (Aurora) when a problem is detected

Aurora allows promotion of a secondary region to be the master

Can be manually promoted to a standalone database instance (non-Aurora) or to be the primary instance (Aurora)

You can combine read replicas with other Amazon RDS features to enjoy the benefits of each.
For example, you can configure a source database as Multi-AZ for high availability and create
a read replica (in Single-AZ) for read scalability. Or you can use Aurora Global Database
to replicate data from your Multi-AZ Aurora deployment into additional regions.

With RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, you can also set the read replica as Multi-AZ,
allowing you to use the read replica as a DR target. When you promote the read replica to be a
standalone database, it will already be Multi-AZ enabled.
