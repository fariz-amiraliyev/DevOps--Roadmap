How can we restore a snapshot to an RDS instance that is managed by terraform?
There is a way to restore the snapshot to a new RDS instance, but when we do a
terraform apply later, this instance is destroyed.

This is how we do it now:
Weâ€™ve written a TF code to restore the RDS from a snapshot using the parameter snapshot_identifier.

  snapshot_identifier         = "${var.db_snapshot_identifier}"
