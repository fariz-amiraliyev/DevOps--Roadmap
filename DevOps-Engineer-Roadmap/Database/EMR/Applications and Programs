Amazon EMR supports many applications, such as Hive, Pig, and the Spark Streaming
library to provide capabilities such as using higher-level languages to create processing workloads,
leveraging machine learning algorithms, making stream processing applications, and building data warehouses.
 In addition, Amazon EMR also supports open-source projects that have their own cluster management
 functionality instead of using YARN.

You use various libraries and languages to interact with the applications that you run in Amazon EMR.
For example, you can use Java, Hive, or Pig with MapReduce or Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, MLlib,
and GraphX with Spark.
