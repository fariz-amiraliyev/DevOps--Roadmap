Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks,
such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data.
By using these frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig,
you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. Additionally,
you can use Amazon EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other
AWS data stores and databases, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.
