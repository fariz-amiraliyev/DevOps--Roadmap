EMR File System (EMRFS)
Using the EMR File System (EMRFS), Amazon EMR extends Hadoop to add the ability
to directly access data stored in Amazon S3 as if it were a file system like HDFS.
You can use either HDFS or Amazon S3 as the file system in your cluster. Most often,
Amazon S3 is used to store input and output data and intermediate results are stored in HDFS.
