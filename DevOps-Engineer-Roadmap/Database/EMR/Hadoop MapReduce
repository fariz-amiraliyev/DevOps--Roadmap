Hadoop MapReduce is an open-source programming model for distributed computing.
It simplifies the process of writing parallel distributed applications by handling
all of the logic, while you provide the Map and Reduce functions. The Map function
maps data to sets of key-value pairs called intermediate results. The Reduce function
combines the intermediate results, applies additional algorithms, and produces the final output.
There are multiple frameworks available for MapReduce, such as Hive, which automatically generates
Map and Reduce programs.
