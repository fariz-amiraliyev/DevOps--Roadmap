Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed, scalable file system for Hadoop.
HDFS distributes the data it stores across instances in the cluster, storing multiple copies
of data on different instances to ensure that no data is lost if an individual instance fails.
HDFS is ephemeral storage that is reclaimed when you terminate a cluster. HDFS is useful for
caching intermediate results during MapReduce processing or for workloads that have significant random I/O.
