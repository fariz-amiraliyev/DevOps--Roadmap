Apache Spark
Spark is a cluster framework and programming model for processing big data workloads.
Like Hadoop MapReduce, Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system but
uses directed acyclic graphs for execution plans and in-memory caching for datasets.
When you run Spark on Amazon EMR, you can use EMRFS to directly access your data in Amazon S3.
Spark supports multiple interactive query modules such as SparkSQL.
