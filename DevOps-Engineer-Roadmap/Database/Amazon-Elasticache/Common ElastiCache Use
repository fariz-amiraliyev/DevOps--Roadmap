If someone wants data, you can deliver that data much faster if it's cached.
That's true whether it's for a webpage or a report that drives business decisions.
Can your business afford to not cache your webpages so as to deliver them with the shortest latency possible?

Even the most optimized database query or remote API call is noticeably slower than retrieving a flat key from an in-memory cache.

it doesn't make sense to cache data that changes quickly or is seldom accessed.
For caching to provide a real benefit, the data should be relatively static and frequently accessed.
