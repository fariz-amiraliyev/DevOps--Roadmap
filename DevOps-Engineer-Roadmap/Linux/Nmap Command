Nmap is Linux command-line tool for network exploration and security auditing.
This tool is generally used by hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts and even
by network and system administrators. It is used for the following purposes:

Real time information of a network
Detailed information of all the IPs activated on your network
Number of ports open in a network
Provide the list of live hosts
Port, OS and Host scaning


It was originally written by Gordon Lyon and it can answer the following questions easily:

Find running computers on the local network
What IP addresses did you find running on the local network?
Discover the operating system of your target machine
Find out what ports are open on the machine that you just scanned?
See if the system is infected with malware or virus.
Search for unauthorized servers or network service on your network.
Locate and remove computers which don’t meet the organization’s minimum level of security.

In case of Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install nmap
In case of CentOS/RedHat
yum install nmap

To scan multile hosts
nmap 103.76.228.244 157.240.198.35 172.217.27.174

To scan whole subnet
nmap 103.76.228.*


To scan to detect firewall settings.
sudo nmap -sA 103.76.228.244

To identify HostnamesTo scan from a file
sudo nmap -sL  103.76.228.244

To scan from a file
nmap -iL input.txt

4. Excluding hosts/networks (IPv4) from nmap scan examples:
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.254
OR exclude list from a file called /tmp/exclude.txt
nmap -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt --excludefile /tmp/exclude.txt

5. 5. Turn on OS and version detection scanning script (IPv4) with nmap
nmap -A 192.168.1.254
nmap -v -A 192.168.1.1
nmap -A -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt

6. 6. Find out if a host/network is protected by a firewall using namp command
## nmap command examples for your host ##
nmap -sA 192.168.1.254
nmap -sA server1.cyberciti.biz

7. 7. Scan a host when protected by the firewall
In this Nmap command examples we are going to scan a router/wifi device having 192.168.1.1 as IP:

nmap -PN 192.168.1.1
nmap -PN server1.cyberciti.biz

8. 9. Scan a network and find out which servers and devices are up and running
This is known as host discovery or ping scan:

nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24

9. 10. How do I perform a fast scan using the namp?
nmap -F 192.168.1.1
nmap -6 -F IPv6_Address_Here

10.11. Display the reason a port is in a particular state
nmap --reason 192.168.1.1
nmap --reason server1.cyberciti.biz

11. 12. Only show open (or possibly open) ports using nmap command in Linux
Run:

nmap --open 192.168.1.1
nmap --open server1.cyberciti.biz
nmap --open 192.168.2.18

12.16: The fastest way to scan all your devices/computers for open ports ever
nmap -T5 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -T5 {sub/net}

13. 19. Scan a host using TCP ACK (PA) and TCP Syn (PS) ping
If firewall is blocking standard ICMP pings, try the following host discovery methods:

nmap -PS 192.168.1.1
nmap -PS 80,21,443 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 80,21,200-512 192.168.1.1
20. Scan a host using IP protocol ping
nmap -PO 192.168.1.1
21. Scan a host using UDP ping
This scan bypasses firewalls and filters that only screen TCP:

nmap -PU 192.168.1.1
nmap -PU 2000.2001 192.168.1.1
22. Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP SYN Scan
### Stealthy scan ###
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using  TCP connect scan (warning: no stealth scan)
###  OS Fingerprinting ###
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1

### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP ACK scan
nmap -sA 192.168.1.1

### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Window scan
nmap -sW 192.168.1.1

### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Maimon scan
nmap -sM 192.168.1.1
23. Scan a host for UDP services (UDP scan)
