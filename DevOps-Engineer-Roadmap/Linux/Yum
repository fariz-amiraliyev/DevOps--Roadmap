yum update
yum update --nogpgcheck   # Update without gpg checking
      You can use the GPG keys to verify the authenticity of an RPM package.
      The –nogpgcheck option in yum will instruct it to skip checking GPG signatures on packages.
      This is useful in cases where you have an unsigned package, or you just don’t have the GPG key.

yum clean all
yum update name-of-package  # update a single package
yum check-update
yum update --exclude=kernel*  or yum update -x 'kernel*'
yum update --exclude=kernel* --exclude=httpd   # Exclude multiple packages
yum history     #Check when last yum update ran
yum history undo 7   # Rollback (revert) update
yum clean all     #Clean up a failed yum update
