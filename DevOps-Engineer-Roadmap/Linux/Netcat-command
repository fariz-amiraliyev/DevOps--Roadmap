Netcat is a Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol.

Following tasks can be done easily with Netcat:

Connect to a port of a target host.
Listen to a certain port for any inbound connections.
Send data across client and server once the connection is established.
Transfer files across the network once the connection is established.
Can execute programs and scripts of the client on the server and vice versa.
Can Provide remote shell access of server to a client where shell commands can be executed.


A simple client-server connection:
nc -l -p 1234
nc 127.0.0.1 1234

Verbose, prints additional information about the connection:
nc -vlp 1234
nc -v 127.0.0.1 1234


After data transfer wait w seconds before terminating the connection:
nc -w 20 -lp 1234
nc -w 2 127.0.0.1 1234

 To perform file transfer:
nc -v -w 30 -l -p 1234 >manav.txt
