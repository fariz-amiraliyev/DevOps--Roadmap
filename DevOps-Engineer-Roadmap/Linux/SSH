ssh-agent $SHELL
ssh-add -L
ssh-add
3 steps:
 ssh-keygen -t rsa
 ssh-copy-id localhost
 sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -Dd
 I found it was not able to read the auth_key
 netstat -tan | grep LIST
/usr/sbin/sshd -d -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
How to ssh to localhost without password?
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
netstat -tan | grep LIST
which ssh



How works SSH ?
