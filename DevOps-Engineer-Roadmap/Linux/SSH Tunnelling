SSH tunneling or SSH port forwarding is a method of creating an encrypted SSH
connection between a client and a server machine through which services ports
can be relayed.

There are three types of SSH port forwarding:

Local Port Forwarding. - Forwards a connection from the client host to the SSH server host and then to the destination host port.
Remote Port Forwarding. - Forwards a port from the server host to the client host and then to the destination host port.
Dynamic Port Forwarding. - Creates SOCKS proxy server which allows communication across a range of ports.

Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port on the local (ssh client) machine to a port on the
remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a port on the destination machine.

Local port forwarding is mostly used to connect to a remote service on an internal network such as a database or VNC server.

ssh -L [LOCAL_IP:]LOCAL_PORT:DESTINATION:DESTINATION_PORT [USER@]SSH_SERVER

You can use any port number greater than 1024 as a LOCAL_PORT. Ports numbers less than 1024 are privileged
ports and can be used only by root. If your SSH server is listening on a port other than 22 (the default) use the -p
[PORT_NUMBER] option.

Let’s say you have a MySQL database server running on machine db001.host on an internal (private) network,
on port 3306 which is accessible from the machine pub001.host and you want to connect using your local
machine mysql client to the database server. To do so you can forward the connection like so:

ssh -L 3336:db001.host:3306 user@pub001.host
ssh -L 3336:db001.host:3306 3337:db002.host:3306 user@pub001.host


Remote Port Forwarding
Remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port forwarding. It allows you to
forward a port on the remote (ssh server) machine to a port on the local (ssh client) machine,
which is then forwarded to a port on the destination machine.
ssh -R [REMOTE:]REMOTE_PORT:DESTINATION:DESTINATION_PORT [USER@]SSH_SERVER

Let’s say you are developing a web application on your local machine and you want to show a preview to
your fellow developer. You do not have a public IP so the other developer can’t access the application via the Internet.
If you have access to a remote SSH server you can set up a remote port forwarding as follows:

ssh -R 8080:127.0.0.1:3000 -N -f user@remote.host
