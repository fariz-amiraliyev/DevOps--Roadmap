The bastion hosts provide secure access to Linux instances located in
the private and public subnets of your virtual private cloud (VPC).

An Auto Scaling group ensures that the number of bastion host instances always matches the capacity you specify.
The Quick Start also sets up Amazon CloudWatch Logs for remote storage of shell history logs, for added security.

A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an
external network, such as the Internet.

Because of its exposure to potential attack, a bastion host must minimize the chances of penetration.

For example, you can use a bastion host to mitigate the risk of allowing SSH connections from an external
network to the Linux instances launched in a private subnet of your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
