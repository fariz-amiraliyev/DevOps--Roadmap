The machines that make up a Kubernetes cluster are called nodes.
Nodes in a Kubernetes cluster may be physical, or virtual.

There are two types of nodes:
A Control-plane-node type, which makes up the Control Plane, acts as the “brains” of the cluster.
A Worker-node type, which makes up the Data Plane, runs the actual container images (via pods).

K8S OBJECTS OVERVIEW:

What pods (containers) are running, and on which nodes
IP endpoints that map to a logical group of containers
How many replicas of a container are running
and more:

Pod
A thin wrapper around one or more containers
DaemonSet
Implements a single instance of a pod on a worker node
Deployment
Details how to roll out (or roll back) across versions of your application

ReplicaSet
Ensures a defined number of pods are always running
Job
Ensures a pod properly runs to completion
Service
Maps a fixed IP address to a logical group of pods
Label
Key/Value pairs used for association and filtering


Control Plane:

Sheduler
Controller manager
ETCD
API Server - kubectl


Worker Node:

Kubelet
Kube-proxy
