nodeSelector is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint.
nodeSelector is a field of PodSpec. It specifies a map of key-value pairs. For
the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated
key-value pairs as labels (it can have additional labels as well). The most common
usage is one key-value pair.
Attach a label to the node
Run kubectl get nodes to get the names of your cluster’s nodes.

kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>


For example, if my node name is ‘ip-192-168-15-64.us-west-2.compute.internal’ and my desired label is ‘disktype=ssd’, then I can run
kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-15-64.us-west-2.compute.internal disktype=ssd

kubectl get nodes --show-labels
