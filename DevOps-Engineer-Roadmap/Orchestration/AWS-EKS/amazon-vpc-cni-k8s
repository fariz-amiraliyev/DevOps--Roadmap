AWS Container Network Interface (amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) plug-in.

This is exactly what the AWS team has done with the amazon-vpc-cni-k8s plug-in. It
leverages EC2â€™s ability to provision multiple elastic network interfaces (ENIs)
to a host instance, each with multiple secondary IP addresses, to get multiple
IPs allocated from the VPC pool. It then hands out these IPs to pods on the host,
connects the ENI to the virtual ethernet port (veth) created on the pod, and lets
the Linux kernel take care of the rest.
