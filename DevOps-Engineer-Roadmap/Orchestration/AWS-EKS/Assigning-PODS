ASSIGNING PODS TO NODES
Generally such constraints are unnecessary, as the scheduler will automatically do a
reasonable placement (e.g. spread your pods across nodes, not place the pod on a node with
insufficient free resources, etc.) but there are some circumstances where you may want more
control on a node where a pod lands, e.g. to ensure that a pod ends up on a machine with an
SSD attached to it, or to co-locate pods from two different services that communicate a lot
into the same availability zone.
