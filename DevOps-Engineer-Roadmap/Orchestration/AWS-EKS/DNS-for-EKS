Amazon EKS now supports automatic DNS resolution for private cluster endpoints.
This feature works automatically for all EKS clusters.

By default, when you create an Amazon EKS cluster, the Kubernetes cluster endpoint
is public. While it is accessible from the internet, access to the Kubernetes cluster
endpoint is restricted by AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

At some point, you may need to configure the Kubernetes cluster endpoint to be private.
 Changing your Kubernetes cluster endpoint access from public to private completely
 disables public access such that it can no longer be accessed from the internet.

 In fact, a cluster that has been configured to only allow private access can only
 be accessed from the following:

The VPC where the worker nodes reside
Networks that have been peered with that VPC
A network that has been connected to AWS through AWS Direct Connect (DX) or a virtual private network (VPN)

However, the name of the Kubernetes cluster endpoint is only resolvable from the worker node VPC, for the following reasons:

The Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone that is created for the endpoint is only associated with the worker node VPC.
The private hosted zone is created in a separate AWS managed account and cannot be altered.

Route 53 inbound and outbound endpoints:
