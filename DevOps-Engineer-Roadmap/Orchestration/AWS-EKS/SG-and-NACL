Difference between NACLs and SGs
NACL and SG are both firewall rules, however they have notable differences that I have summarized in the following table:

 	NACL	SG
Scopes	subnet or VPC - applies to all instances in the subnet or VPC	instance - applies to all instances linked to the SG
Cardinality	1 NACL per subnet or VPC	1 to many SG per instance or instance group
Actions	allow or deny	allow - every unspecified rule defaults to deny
States	stateless - i.e. NACLs allow traffic looking at the IP and port regardless of the fact that it is a reply request	statefull - i.e. SGs automatically allow a reply to be returned. They maintain a state table that tracks the origin and destination IP and port. Only one rule (inbound or outbound) is required
Rule order	rules are applied in order	rules are applied simultaneously


Note that inbound traffic first passes through the NACL firewalls then to the SG firewalls. Outbound traffic goes the opposite way.

Firewall requirement for EKS
The AWS documentation specifies the following requirements:

traffic needs to be allowed between the control plane and managed node groups
traffic needs to be allowed between nodes
nodes and control plane should have outbound access to the internet.
Note that one of the possibilities your nodes might not join your cluster is if they do not have access to the internet. Indeed, they need access to the Amazon EKS API.

SG configuration for EKS
Taking into account above consideration, here is an SG proposition for EKS.

Inbound

Protocol	Port	Source
TCP	443	self
TCP	1024 - 65535	self


Outbound

Protocol	Port	Destination
TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0
TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0
TCP	1024 - 65535	0.0.0.0/0
NACL configuration for EKS
Taking into account above consideration, here is a NACL proposition for EKS.

Inbound

Rule #	Protocol	Port	Source	Allow / Deny
100	TCP	All	self	Allow
200	TCP	1024 - 65535	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
9000	All	All	All	Deny


Outbound

Rule #	Protocol	Port	Destination	Allow / Deny
100	TCP	All	self	Allow
200	TCP	1024 - 65535	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
300	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
400	TCP	443	0.0.0.0/0	Allow
9000	All	All	All	Deny
