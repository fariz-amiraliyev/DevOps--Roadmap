We need Helm to deploy the AWS Node Termination Handler:

Demand for Spot Instances can vary significantly, and as a consequence the availability
of Spot Instances will also vary depending on how many unused EC2 instances are available.
It is always possible that your Spot Instance might be interrupted. In this case the Spot
Instances are sent an interruption notice two minutes ahead to gracefully wrap up things.
We will deploy a pod on each spot instance to detect and redeploy applications elsewhere
in the cluster.

The first thing that we need to do is deploy the AWS Node Termination Handler
on each Spot Instance. This will monitor the EC2 metadata service on the instance
for an interruption notice. The termination handler consists of a ServiceAccount,
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, and a DaemonSet.


helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts

helm upgrade --install aws-node-termination-handler \
             --namespace kube-system \
             --set nodeSelector.lifecycle=Ec2Spot \
              eks/aws-node-termination-handler

kubectl --namespace=kube-system get daemonsets
