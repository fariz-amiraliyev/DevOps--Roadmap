Helm is a package manager and application management tool for Kubernetes that
packages multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit
called a Chart.

Helm helps you to:

Achieve a simple (one command) and repeatable deployment
Manage application dependency, using specific versions of other application and services
Manage multiple deployment configurations: test, staging, production and others
Execute post/pre deployment jobs during application deployment
Update/rollback and test application deployments
