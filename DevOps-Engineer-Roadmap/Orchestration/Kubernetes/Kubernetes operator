A Kubernetes operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.
 A Kubernetes application is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes
 API (application programming interface) and kubectl tooling.

A Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality
of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications
on behalf of a Kubernetes user.
