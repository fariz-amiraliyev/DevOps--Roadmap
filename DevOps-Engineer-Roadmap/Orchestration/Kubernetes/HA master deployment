Set up High-Availability Kubernetes Masters
You can replicate Kubernetes masters in kube-up or kube-down scripts for Google Compute Engine.

Best practices for replicating masters for HA clusters
Try to place master replicas in different zones. During a zone failure, all masters
placed inside the zone will fail. To survive zone failure, also place nodes in multiple
zones (see multiple-zones for details).

Do not use a cluster with two master replicas. Consensus on a two-replica cluster
requires both replicas running when changing persistent state. As a result, both
replicas are needed and a failure of any replica turns cluster into majority failure state.
A two-replica cluster is thus inferior, in terms of HA, to a single replica cluster.

When you add a master replica, cluster state (etcd) is copied to a new instance.
If the cluster is large, it may take a long time to duplicate its state. This operation
may be sped up by migrating etcd data directory, as described here (we are considering
adding support for etcd data dir migration in future).
