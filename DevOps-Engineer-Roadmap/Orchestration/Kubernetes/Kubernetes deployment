A Kubernetes deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative
updates to applications. A deployment allows you to describe an application’s life
cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pods there should be,
and the way in which they should be updated.


A Kubernetes object is a way to tell the Kubernetes system how you want your
cluster’s workload to look. After an object has been created, the cluster works
to ensure that the object exists, maintaining the desired state of your
Kubernetes cluster.

The Kubernetes deployment object lets you:

Deploy a replica set or pod
Update pods and replica sets
Rollback to previous deployment versions
Scale a deployment
Pause or continue a deployment
