Rolling update strategy
A rolling update strategy provides a controlled, phased replacement of the application's
pods, ensuring that there are always a minimum number available.

The deployment makes sure that, by default, a maximum of only 25% of pods are
unavailable at any time, and it also wonâ€™t over provision more than 25% of the
number of pods specified in the desired state.
With a rolling update strategy there is no downtime during the update process,
however the application must be architected to ensure that it can tolerate the
pod destroy and create operations.

During the update process 2 versions of the container are running at the same
time, which may cause issues for the service consumers.
