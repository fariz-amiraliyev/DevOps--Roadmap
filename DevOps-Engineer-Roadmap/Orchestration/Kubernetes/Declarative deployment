Declarative deployment pattern for Kubernetes
Deployments are created by writing a manifest. The manifest is then applied to
the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply, or you can use a declarative deployment pattern.
Configuration files for Kubernetes can be written using YAML or JSON.

When creating a deployment, youâ€™ll describe the desired state and Kubernetes will
implement it using either a rolling or recreate deployment strategy.
