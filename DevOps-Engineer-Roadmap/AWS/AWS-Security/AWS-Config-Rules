An AWS Config rule represents your desired configuration settings for
specific AWS resources or for an entire AWS account. AWS Config provides
customizable, predefined rules to help you get started. If a resource violates
a rule, AWS Config flags the resource and the rule as noncompliant, and AWS Config
notifies you through Amazon SNS.

After you activate a rule, AWS Config compares your resources to the conditions of
the rule. After this initial evaluation, AWS Config continues to run evaluations each
time one is triggered. The evaluation triggers are defined as part of the rule,
and they can include the following types:
Configuration changes
