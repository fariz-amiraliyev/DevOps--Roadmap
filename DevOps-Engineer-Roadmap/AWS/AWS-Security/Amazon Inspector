Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of
applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities,
and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of
security findings prioritized by level of severity. These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed
assessment reports which are available via the Amazon Inspector console or API.

Amazon Inspector security assessments help you check for unintended network accessibility of your Amazon EC2
instances and for vulnerabilities on those EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector assessments are offered to you as
pre-defined rules packages mapped to common security best practices and vulnerability definitions. Examples of
built-in rules include checking for access to your EC2 instances from the internet, remote root login being enabled,
or vulnerable software versions installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.
