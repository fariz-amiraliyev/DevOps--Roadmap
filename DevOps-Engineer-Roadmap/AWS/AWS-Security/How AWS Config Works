When you turn on AWS Config, it first discovers the supported AWS resources that exist in your
account and generates a configuration item for each resource.

AWS Config also generates configuration items when the configuration of a resource
changes, and it maintains historical records of the configuration items of your resources
from the time you start the configuration recorder. By default, AWS Config creates
configuration items for every supported resource in the region. If you don't want
AWS Config to create configuration items for all supported resources, you can
specify the resource types that you want it to track.

AWS Config keeps track of all changes to your resources by invoking the Describe
or the List API call for each resource in your account. The service uses those
same API calls to capture configuration details for all related resources.

AWS Config tracks changes in the configuration of your AWS resources, and
it regularly sends updated configuration details to an Amazon S3 bucket that you
 specify. For each resource type that AWS Config records, it sends a configuration
 history file every six hours. Each configuration history file contains details
 about the resources that changed in that six-hour period. Each file includes
 resources of one type, such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon EBS volumes.
 If no configuration changes occur, AWS Config does not send a file.


 An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic is a communication
 channel that Amazon SNS uses to deliver messages (or notifications) to
 subscribing endpoints such as an email address or clients. Other types of
 Amazon SNS notifications include push notification messages to apps on mobile
 phones, Short Message Service (SMS) notifications to SMS-enabled mobile phones
 and smart phones, and HTTP POST requests. For best results, use Amazon SQS as
 the notification endpoint for the SNS topic and then process the information in
 the notification programmatically.
