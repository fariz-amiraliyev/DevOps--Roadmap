The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones.
Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed
in separate facilities.
These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications
and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from
a single data center.

The AWS Cloud operates in over 60 Availability Zones within over 20 geographic
Regions around the world, with announced plans for more Availability Zones and Regions.
