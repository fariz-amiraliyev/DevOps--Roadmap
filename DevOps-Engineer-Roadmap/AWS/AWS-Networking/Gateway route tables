When a route table is associated with a gateway, it's referred to as a gateway
route table. Gateway route table  control over the routing path of traffic entering to VPC.

A gateway route table supports routes where the target is local (the default
local route) or an elastic network interface (network interface) in your VPC
that's attached to your middlebox appliance.

Rules and considerations
You cannot associate a route table with a gateway if any of the following applies:

The route table contains existing routes with targets other than a network interface or the
default local route.

The route table contains existing routes to CIDR blocks outside of the ranges in your VPC.

Route propagation is enabled for the route table.

In addition, the following rules and considerations apply:

You cannot add routes to any CIDR blocks outside of the ranges in your VPC, including
 ranges larger than the individual VPC CIDR blocks.

You can only specify local or a network interface as a target. You cannot specify
any other types of targets, including individual host IP addresses.

You cannot specify a prefix list as a destination.

You cannot use a gateway route table to control or intercept traffic outside of
your VPC, for example, traffic through an attached transit gateway.
You can intercept traffic that enters your VPC and redirect it to another target in the same VPC only.

To ensure that traffic reaches your middlebox appliance, the target network
interface must be attached to a running instance. For a traffic that flows
through an internet gateway, the target network interface must also have a public IP address.

When configuring your middlebox appliance, take note of the appliance considerations.

When you route traffic through a middlebox appliance, the return traffic from the
destination subnet must be routed through the same appliance. Asymmetric routing is not supported.
