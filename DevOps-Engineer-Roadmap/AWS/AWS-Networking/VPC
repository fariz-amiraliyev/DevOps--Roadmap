Default PVC CIDR range: 172.31.0.0/16


When we create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC.
The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28
netmask (16 IP addresses). After you've created your VPC, you can associate secondary CIDR blocks with the VPC.

10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)

172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

The allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask.
If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap.

For example, if you create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, it supports 256 IP
addresses. You can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP
addresses. One subnet uses CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127)
and the other uses CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255).

The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are
not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance. For example,
in a subnet with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, the following five IP addresses are reserved:

10.0.0.0: Network address.

10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.

10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of
the VPC network range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP
address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR. We also reserve
the base of each subnet range plus two for all CIDR blocks in the VPC.
For more information, see Amazon DNS server.

10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.

10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC,
therefore we reserve this address.
