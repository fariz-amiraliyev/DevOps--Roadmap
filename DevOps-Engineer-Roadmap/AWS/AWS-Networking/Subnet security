AWS provides two features to increase security in VPC:
Security groups and network ACLs.
Security groups control inbound and outbound traffic for instances, and
network ACLs control inbound and outbound traffic for subnets.
By design, each subnet must be associated with a network ACL.
Every subnet that is automatically associated with the VPC's default network ACL.
