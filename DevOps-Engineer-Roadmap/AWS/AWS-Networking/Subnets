We can optionally add subnets in a Local Zone, which is an AWS infrastructure
deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to end users.

Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated
from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate
Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.
If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.
If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic
routed to a virtual private gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.

VPC  10.0.0.0/16

and 3 availibility zones:
1. 10.0.0.0/18      /21
2. 10.0.64.0/18     /21
3. 10.0.128.0/18    /21

Subnet addressing:
1. Define AZs
2. Determine CIDR range
3. AWS reserved addresses
