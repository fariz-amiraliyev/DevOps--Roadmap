A VPC endpoint enables to privately connect  VPC to supported AWS
services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring
an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
Instances in VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with
resources in the service. Traffic between VPC and the other service does
not leave the Amazon network.

There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address
from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for
traffic destined to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by
AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by
using private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all network traffic
between your VPC and services to the Amazon network. You do not need an internet
gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.

A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a
route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service.
The following AWS services are supported:
