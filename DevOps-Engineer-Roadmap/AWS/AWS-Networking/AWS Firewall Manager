AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and Amazon VPC security groups
administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources. With Firewall Manager,
you set up your AWS WAF firewall rules, Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups
just once. The service automatically applies the rules and protections across your accounts and resources,
even as you add new resources.
Firewall Manager provides these benefits:
• Helps to protect resources across accounts
• Helps to protect all resources of a particular type, such as all Amazon CloudFront distributions
• Helps to protect all resources with specific tags
• Automatically adds protection to resources that are added to your account
• Allows you to subscribe all member accounts in an AWS Organizations organization to AWS Shield
Advanced, and automatically subscribes new in-scope accounts that join the organization
• Allows you to apply security group rules to all member accounts or specific subsets of accounts in an
AWS Organizations organization, and automatically applies the rules to new in-scope accounts that
join the organization
• Lets you use your own rules, or purchase managed rules from AWS Marketplace
Firewall Manager is particularly useful when you want to protect your entire organization rather than a
small number of specific accounts and resources, or if you frequently add new resources that you want to
protect. Firewall Manager also provides centralized monitoring of DDoS attacks across your organization


You can use AWS Firewall Manager security group policies to manage Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud security groups for your organization in AWS Organizations.
You can apply centrally controlled security group policies to your entire organization or to
a select subset of your accounts and resources. You can also monitor and manage the
security group policies that are in use in your organization, with auditing and usage
security group policies.
