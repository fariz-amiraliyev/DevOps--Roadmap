Amazon VPC concepts
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ug.pdf#what-is-amazon-vpc
The following are the key concepts for VPCs:

Virtual private cloud (VPC) — A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.

Subnet — A range of IP addresses in your VPC.

Route table — A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

Internet gateway — A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.

VPC endpoint — Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services
and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway,
 NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do
 not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service.
 Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

 A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated
 from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2
 instances, into your VPC. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security
 groups, and configure route tables.
 A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet.
 Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for
 resources that won't be connected to the internet .
 To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security
 groups and network access control lists (ACL).
