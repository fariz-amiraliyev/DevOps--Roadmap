  An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant,
and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over
IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet
from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.


IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and are therefore public by default.

If you want your instance to be able to access the internet,
but you want to prevent resources on the internet from initiating
communication with your instance, you can use an egress-only internet gateway.
To do this, create an egress-only internet gateway in your VPC, and then add a
route to your route table that points all IPv6 traffic (::/0) or a specific
range of IPv6 address to the egress-only internet gateway. IPv6 traffic in the
subnet that's associated with the route table is routed to the egress-only
internet gateway.

An egress-only internet gateway is stateful: it forwards traffic from the
instances in the subnet to the internet or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances.

An egress-only internet gateway has the following characteristics:

You cannot associate a security group with an egress-only internet gateway.
You can use security groups for your instances in the private subnet to control the traffic to and from those instances.

You can use a network ACL to control the traffic to and from the subnet
for which the egress-only internet gateway routes traffic.
