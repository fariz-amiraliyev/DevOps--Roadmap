Inbound  traffic
Outbound traffic
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control
inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC,
you can assign up to five security groups to the instance.
Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level.
Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a
different set of security groups.

Number of security groups that can create per VPC: 2500
Number of rules that can add to each security group: 60
Number of security groups that can associate with a network interface: 5


You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

You can specify separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no
inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed
When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound
traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed until you add inbound
rules to the security group.
until you add inbound rules to the security group.


By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all
outbound traffic. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that
allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound
rules, no outbound traffic originating from your instance is allowed.


Security groups are stateful â€” if you send a request from your instance,
the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of
inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are
allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.
