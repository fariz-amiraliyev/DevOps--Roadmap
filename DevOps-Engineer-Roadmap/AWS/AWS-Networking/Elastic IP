An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
An Elastic IP address can associate be with any instance or network interface
in any VPC in your account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure
of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your VPC.


An Elastic IP address is a property of a network interface. We can associate an
Elastic IP address with an instance by updating
the network interface attached to the instance.


An Elastic IP address can be associated with a single instance or network interface at a time.

You can move an Elastic IP address from one instance or network interface to another.
If you associate an Elastic IP address with the eth0 network interface of your instance,
its current public IPv4 address (if it had one) is released to the EC2-VPC public IP address pool.
If you disassociate the Elastic IP address, the eth0 network interface is automatically
assigned a new public IPv4 address within a few minutes. This doesn't apply
if you've attached a second network interface to your instance.

You're limited to five Elastic IP addresses.

An Elastic IP address is accessed through the internet gateway of a VPC.
If you have set up an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between your VPC and your network,
the VPN traffic traverses a virtual private gateway, not an internet gateway,
and therefore cannot access the Elastic IP address.
