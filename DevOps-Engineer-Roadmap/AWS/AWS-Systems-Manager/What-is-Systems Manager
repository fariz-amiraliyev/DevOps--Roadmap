How Systems Manager works:
Configure Systems Manager: Use the Systems Manager console, SDK, AWS CLI, or AWS Tools
for Windows PowerShell to configure, schedule, automate, and run actions that you want
to perform on your AWS resources.

Verification and processing: Systems Manager verifies the configurations, including
permissions, and sends requests to the SSM Agent running on your instances or servers
in your hybrid environment. SSM Agent performs the specified configuration changes.

Reporting: SSM Agent reports the status of the configuration changes and actions to
Systems Manager in the AWS cloud. Systems Manager then sends the status to the user
and various AWS services, if configured.
