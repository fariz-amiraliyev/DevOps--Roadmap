VPC peering is a tool we can use when we want our VPCs to communicate using private
IP addresses as if they are on the same network. We also have the newly released
ability to peer VPCs across regions.

UPDATE: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now supports IPv6 traffic over Inter-Region
 VPC Peering. With this launch, your resources in different AWS regions,
 can communicate with each other using IPv6 addresses without requiring gateways,
 VPN connections, or separate physical hardware. Inter-Region VPC Peering encrypts
 inter-region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck. Traffic
 using Inter-Region VPC Peering always stays on the AWS global network and never traverses
 the public internet.
