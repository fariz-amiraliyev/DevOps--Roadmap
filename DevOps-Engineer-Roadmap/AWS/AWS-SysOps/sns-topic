Amazon SNS is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending
of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients.

There are two types of clients—publishers and subscribers—also referred to as producers and consumers.
Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message
to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel.

Subscribers (that is, web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues,
AWS Lambda functions) consume or receive the message or notification over one of
the supported protocols (that is, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda) when
they are subscribed to the topic.

When using Amazon SNS, you create a topic and control access to it
by defining policies that determine which publishers and subscribers can communicate
with the topic. A publisher sends messages to topics that they have created or to
topics they have permission to publish to. Instead of including a specific
destination address in each message, a publisher sends a message to the topic.


Common Amazon SNS scenarios:
1. The "fanout" scenario is when an Amazon SNS message is sent to a topic
and then replicated and pushed to multiple Amazon SQS queues, HTTP endpoints, or email addresses.
Another way to use "fanout" is to replicate data sent to your production environment with your test environment.

2. Application and system alerts
3. Push email and text messaging
4. Mobile push notifications
5. Message durability


Amazon SNS provides support to log the delivery status of notification messages
sent to topics with the following Amazon SNS endpoints:
