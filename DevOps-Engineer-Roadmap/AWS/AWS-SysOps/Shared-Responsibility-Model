  AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that supports 
its cloud platform. You, the customer, are responsible for any resources you
operate on, place in, or connect to AWS. This shared responsibility model can
reduce your total cost of ownership and help improve your security posture
without the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in an on-premises
infrastructure.
