VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP
traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published
to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can
retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.
