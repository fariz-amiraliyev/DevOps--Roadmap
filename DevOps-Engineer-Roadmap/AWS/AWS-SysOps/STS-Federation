Identity federation needs to be understood for us to administer our 
applications on AWS. STS affects both customers and employees. For users,
they often need to authenticate into our applications with third-party
providers. For employees, they can use their domain credentials from
on-premises services such as Active Directory to authenticate into and use
AWS services.
