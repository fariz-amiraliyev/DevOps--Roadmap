CloudWatch Logs

CloudWatch Logs automatically collects logs from many AWS services.
You can also use the unified CloudWatch agent to collect and store logs
from your custom applications and services.

You can use metric filters to publish log-based metrics or to create alarms
that notify you about potential operational issues.


You can export log data from your log groups to an Amazon S3 bucket and use
this data in custom processing and analysis, or to load onto other systems.
