Integrating AWS CLI with AWS SSO

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/integrating-aws-cli.html

AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) 2.0 preview integration with AWS Single Sign-On
(AWS SSO) enables developers to sign in directly to the CLI using the same
Active Directory or AWS SSO credentials that they normally use to sign in to
AWS SSO, and access their assigned accounts and roles. For example, an administrator
configures AWS SSO to use Active Directory for authentication, a developer can
then sign into the CLI directly using their Active Directory credentials.


How to integrate AWS CLI with AWS SSO
To use the AWS CLI integration with AWS SSO, you will need to download the
AWS CLI preview version 2.0 of the CLI. For detailed steps on how to download and
integrate the CLI with AWS SSO, see Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS Single
Sign-On (AWS SSO) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
