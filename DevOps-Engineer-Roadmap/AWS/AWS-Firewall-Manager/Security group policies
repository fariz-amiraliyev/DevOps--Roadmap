AWS Firewall Manager security group policies manage Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud security groups for your organization in AWS Organizations.
You can apply centrally controlled security group policies to your entire
organization or to a select subset of your accounts and resources. You can also
monitor and manage the security group policies that are in use in your organization,
with auditing and usage security group policies.

We can use Firewall Manager security group policies to do the following across your AWS organization:
Apply common security groups to specified accounts and resources.
Audit security group rules, to locate and remediate noncompliant rules.
Audit usage of security groups, to clean up unused and redundant security groups.
