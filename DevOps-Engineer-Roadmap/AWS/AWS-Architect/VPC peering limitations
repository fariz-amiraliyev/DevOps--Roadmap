You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have matching or
overlapping IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks. Amazon always assigns your VPC a unique I
Pv6 CIDR block. If your IPv6 CIDR blocks are unique but your IPv4 blocks are not,
 you cannot create the peering connection.

 You have a quota on the number of active and pending VPC peering connections:
 Active VPC peering connections per VPC :50
 Outstanding VPC peering connection requests : 25


 VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships. In a
 VPC peering connection, your VPC does not have access to any other VPCs
 with which the peer VPC may be peered. This includes VPC peering connections
 that are established entirely within your own AWS account.

You cannot have more than one VPC peering connection between the same two VPCs at the same time.

An inter-region VPC peering connection has additional limitations:

You cannot create a security group rule that references a peer VPC security group.

You cannot enable support for an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to a VPC via
ClassicLink to communicate with the peer VPC.

The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) across the VPC peering connection is 1500 bytes
(jumbo frames are not supported).

You must enable DNS resolution support for the VPC peering connection to resolve private
DNS hostnames of the peered VPC to private IP addresses, even if the IPv4 CIDR for the VPC
falls into the private IPv4 address ranges specified by RFC 1918.

Inter-region peering in China is only allowed between the China (Beijing) Region,
operated by SINNET and the China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD.
