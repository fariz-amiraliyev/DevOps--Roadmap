Enabling internet access
To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC,
you must do the following:

Attach an internet gateway to your VPC.

Add a route to your subnet's route table that directs internet-bound traffic
to the internet gateway. If a subnet is associated with a route table that has
a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a public subnet. If a subnet is
associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet
gateway, it's known as a private subnet.

Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address
(public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).

Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules
allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance.
