AWS Backup
centrally manages and automates backups across AWS services
Define Backup plans, schedule backups, automate backup retention management, centrally monitor backup activity, and restore backups.


Centrally manage backups
Simplify backup management from a centralized console to protect your storage volumes, databases, and file systems.
The AWS Backup console enables you to manage all backup activity with a consolidated view for monitoring and alerts.
Use the console, APIs, or CLI as a consistent method to backup, restore, and set retention across AWS services in the
cloud and on-premises.
