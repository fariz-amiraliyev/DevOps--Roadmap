Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization.

SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization.

SCPs alone are not sufficient for allowing access in the accounts in your organization. Attaching an SCP to an AWS
 Organizations entity (root, organizational unit (OU), or account) defines a guardrail for what actions the principals
 can perform. You still need to attach identity-based or resource-based policies to principals or resources in your organization's
 accounts to actually grant permissions to them. When a principal belongs to an account that is a member of an organization,
 the SCPs contribute to the principal's effective permissions.

 SCPs are similar to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission policies and use almost the same syntax. However, an SCP never
 grants permissions. Instead, SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU).
 For more information, see Policy Evaluation Logic in the IAM User Guide.
