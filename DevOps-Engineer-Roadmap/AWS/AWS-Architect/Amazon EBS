EBS volumes are created in a specific Availability Zone, and can then be attached to any
instances in that same Availability Zone. To make a volume available outside of the Availability Zone,
you can create a snapshot and restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in that Region.
You can copy snapshots to other Regions and then restore them to new volumes there, making it easier to
leverage multiple AWS Regions for geographical expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery.

Amazon EBS provides the following volume types: General Purpose SSD (gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2),
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1). The following is a summary of performance and use cases for each volume type.
