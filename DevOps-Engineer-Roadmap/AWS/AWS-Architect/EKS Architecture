A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
 A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to
provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
 In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for
resources in the private subnets.*
 In one public subnet, a Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound
Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in
private subnets. The bastion host is also configured with the Kubernetes kubectl
command line interface (CLI) for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
 An Amazon EKS cluster, which provides the Kubernetes control plane.
 In the private subnets, a group of Kubernetes nodes.

This deployment enables users of the Amazon EKS cluster to be able to create ELB load
balancers and Amazon EBS volumes as part of their Kubernetes applications. As these carry
additional costs, we recommend that you grant users of the Amazon EKS cluster only the
permissions they require via Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and that you
monitor the resource usage by using the Kubernetes CLI or the Kubernetes API to describe
the persistent volume claims (PVC) and LoadBalancer resources across all namespaces. To
disable this functionality, you can update the ControlPlaneRole IAM role created in the
IAM child stack to deny the Kubernetes control plane access to specific AWS APIs like
ec2:CreateVolume or elb:CreateLoadBalancer.
