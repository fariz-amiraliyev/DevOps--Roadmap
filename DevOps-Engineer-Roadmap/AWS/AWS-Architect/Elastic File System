Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system
for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.


Amazon EFS offers two storage classes: the Standard storage class, and the Infrequent Access storage class (EFS IA).

Amazon EFS is designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling your
applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS with consistent low latencies.


Recently, AWS announced Amazon EFS support for AWS Lambda. It enables customers to easily share data across function invocations.
It also allows you to read large reference data files, and write function output to a persistent and shared data store. Customers
can now use Lambda to build data-intensive applications, and load larger libraries and models. They can process larger amounts of
data in a highly distributed manner, and share data across functions, containers, and instances.


Using EFS and Lambda for deep learning inference requires to execute two steps:

Storing the deep learning libraries and model on EFS
Creating a Lambda function for inference, which loads the libraries and model from the EFS file system
