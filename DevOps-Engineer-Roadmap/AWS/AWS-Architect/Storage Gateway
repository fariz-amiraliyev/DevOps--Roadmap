AWS Storage Gateway connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage
to provide integration with data security features between on-premises IT environment and
the AWS storage infrastructure.

Virtual machine that car be tun on-premise with VMware.
Provides local storage recources backed on S3 and Glacier.
Often used in Disaster Recovery for sync data.
Useful in cloud migration.

AWS Storage Gateway offers file-based, volume-based, and tape-based storage solutions:

1. File Gateway.
   Can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file

   Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.
2. Volume Gateway Stored Mode.
   Volume Gateway – A volume gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that
   you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) devices
   from your on-premises application servers.
   The volume gateway is deployed into your on-premises environment as a VM running on VMware ESXi, KVM, or Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.
3. Volume Gateway Cached Mode. Cached volumes – You store your data in Amazon
   Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally.
4. Tape Gateway.
   A tape gateway provides cloud-backed virtual tape storage. The tape gateway
