IAM groups allow for large-scale management of IAM users.
This way, policies can be applied to groups and impact collections
of similar users.

IAM Groups not real identities Note that a group is not truly an
"identity" in IAM because it cannot be identified as a Principal in a
permission policy. It is simply a way to attach policies to multiple users
at one time.
