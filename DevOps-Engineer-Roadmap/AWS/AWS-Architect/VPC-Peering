A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that
enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or
IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as
if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection
between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in
different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).

A VPC peering connection helps you to facilitate the transfer of data.
For example, if you have more than one AWS account, you can peer the VPCs
across those accounts to create a file sharing network. You can also use a
VPC peering connection to allow other VPCs to access resources you have in one
of your VPCs.

You can establish peering relationships between VPCs across different AWS Regions
(also called Inter-Region VPC Peering). This allows VPC resources including EC2
instances, Amazon RDS databases and Lambda functions that run in different AWS
Regions to communicate with each other using private IP addresses, without
requiring gateways, VPN connections, or separate network appliances.
The traffic remains in the private IP space. All inter-region traffic is
 encrypted with no single point of failure, or bandwidth bottleneck.
 Traffic always stays on the global AWS backbone, and never traverses the public
 internet, which reduces threats, such as common exploits, and DDoS attacks.
 Inter-Region VPC Peering provides a simple and cost-effective way to share
 resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy.
