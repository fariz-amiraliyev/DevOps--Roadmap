The owner of the requester VPC sends a request to the owner of the accepter
VPC to create the VPC peering connection. The accepter VPC can be owned by you,
or another AWS account, and cannot have a CIDR block that overlaps with the
requester VPC's CIDR block.

The owner of the accepter VPC accepts the VPC peering connection request
to activate the VPC peering connection.

To enable the flow of traffic between the VPCs using private IP addresses,
the owner of each VPC in the VPC peering connection must manually add a
route to one or more of their VPC route tables that points to the IP address
range of the other VPC (the peer VPC).

If required, update the security group rules that are associated with your
instance to ensure that traffic to and from the peer VPC is not restricted.
If both VPCs are in the same region, you can reference a security group from
the peer VPC as a source or destination for ingress or egress rules in your
security group rules.

By default, if instances on either side of a VPC peering connection address
each other using a public DNS hostname, the hostname resolves to the instance's
public IP address. To change this behavior, enable DNS hostname resolution for
your VPC connection. After enabling DNS hostname resolution, if instances on
either side of the VPC peering connection address each other using a public
DNS hostname, the hostname resolves to the private IP address of the instance.


VPC peering connection lifecycle:

A VPC peering connection is a one to one relationship between two VPCs.
You can create multiple VPC peering connections for each VPC that you own,
but transitive peering relationships are not supported. You do not have any
peering relationship with VPCs that your VPC is not directly peered with.
