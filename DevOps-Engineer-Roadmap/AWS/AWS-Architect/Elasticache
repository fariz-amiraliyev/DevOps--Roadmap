Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and
scale a distributed in-memory data store or cache environment in the cloud.

It provides a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution.

Existing applications that use Redis can use ElastiCache with almost no modification.
Your applications simply need information about the host names and port numbers of
the ElastiCache nodes that you have deployed.


ElastiCache for Redis has multiple features that help make the service more reliable
for critical production deployments:

Automatic detection of and recovery from cache node failures.

Multi-AZ for a failed primary cluster to a read replica, in Redis clusters that support replication.

Redis (cluster mode enabled) supports partitioning your data across up to 90 shards.

For Redis version 3.2.and later, all versions support encryption in transit and encryption at
rest encryption with authentication. This support helps you build HIPAA-compliant applications.

Flexible Availability Zone placement of nodes and clusters for increased fault tolerance.

Integration with other AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail,
and Amazon SNS. This integration helps provide a managed in-memory caching solution that
is high-performance and highly secure.

Amazon ElastiCache supports the Memcached and Redis cache engines. Each engine provides
some advantages. Use the information in this topic to help you choose the engine and
version that best meets your requirements.
