Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and
retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

This guide describes how you send requests to create buckets, store and
retrieve your objects, and manage permissions on your resources. The guide
also describes access control and the authentication process. Access control
defines who can access objects and buckets within Amazon S3, and the type of
access (for example, READ and WRITE). The authentication process verifies the
identity of a user who is trying to access Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Operations:

Common operations

Create a bucket – Create and name your own bucket in which to store your objects.

Write an object – Store data by creating or overwriting an object. When you write an object, you specify a unique key in the namespace of your bucket. This is also a good time to specify any access control you want on the object.

Read an object – Read data back. You can download the data via HTTP or BitTorrent.

Delete an object – Delete some of your data.

List keys – List the keys contained in one of your buckets. You can filter the key list based on a prefix.
