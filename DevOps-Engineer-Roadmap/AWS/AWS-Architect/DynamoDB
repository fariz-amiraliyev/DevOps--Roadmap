Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service.
With DynamoDB, we can create database tables that can store and retrieve any
amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. DynamoDB provides on-demand
backup capability.
It allows to create full backups of tables for long-term retention and archival for
regulatory compliance needs.
High Availability and Durability DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic
for tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle throughput and storage
requirements, while  maintaining consistent and fast performance.
