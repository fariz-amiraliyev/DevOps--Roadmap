AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to
establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.
Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity
between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment,
which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth
throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than
Internet-based connections.


Reduces your bandwidth costs
If you have bandwidth-heavy workloads that you wish to run in AWS,
AWS Direct Connect reduces your network costs into and out of AWS in
two ways. First, by transferring data to and from AWS directly, you can
reduce your bandwidth commitment to your Internet service provider.
Second, all data transferred over your dedicated connection is charged at
the reduced AWS Direct Connect data transfer rate rather than Internet data
transfer rates.
