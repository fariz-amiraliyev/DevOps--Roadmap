THE ACID Model for Database Management:

Defining the ACID Model

Here are more specifics on the characteristics of the ACID model.

Atomicity. Transactions are made up of multiple statements. Atomicity ensures that each transaction
           is treated as a single unit that either succeeds or fails. So, if any of the statements within a
           transaction fail, the whole transaction fails and the database is left unchanged.


Consistency. Consistency ensures that only valid data is included in the database.
             If a transaction violates the databaseâ€™s consistency rules,
             it will be stopped and the database will be unchanged.
             This prevents illegal transactions from taking place.

Isolation. Isolation means that multiple transactions happening at the same time will
           not impact each other. Isolation supports concurrency control and prevents
           transactions from interfering with each other.

Durability. Once a transaction is complete, it will remain that way, even if there is a system failure.
            Durability is ensured through database backups, transaction logs and other security measures.
