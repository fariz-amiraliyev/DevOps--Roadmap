With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud
without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces
management complexity without restricting choice or control. After uploading your application, Elastic
Beanstalk will automatically handle the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and
application health monitoring.
