Amazon SQS
 Using Amazon SQS, can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing
messages or requiring other services to be available.
Messages are stored in queues that you create. Each queue is defined as a URL, so it can be accessed by
any server that has access to the Internet, subject to the Access Control List (ACL) of that queue.
Use Amazon SQS to ensure that your queue is always available; any messages that you send to a queue are
retained for up to 14 days.
SQS offers two types of message queues:
Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort
ordering, and at-least-once delivery with best-effort ordering.
SQS FIFO queues offer high throughput
and are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are
sent.
Amazon SQS message queuing can be used with other AWS Services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon
DynamoDB, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container
Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3, to make distributed applications more scalable and
reliable.
