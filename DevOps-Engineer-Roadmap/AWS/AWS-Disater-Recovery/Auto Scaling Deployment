Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to take advantage of the safety and
reliability of geographic redundancy by spanning Auto Scaling groups across
multiple Availability Zones within a Region. When one Availability Zone becomes
unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new instances in an unaffected Availability Zone.
When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a healthy state, Auto Scaling automatically
redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the designated Availability Zones.
