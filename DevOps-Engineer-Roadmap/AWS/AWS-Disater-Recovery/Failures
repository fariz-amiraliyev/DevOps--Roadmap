Software systems degrade over time. This is due in part to:
• Software leaking memory and/or resources, including software that you wrote and software that you
depend on (such as application frameworks, operating systems, and device drivers).
• File systems fragmenting over time which impacts performance.
• Hardware (particularly storage) devices physically degrading over time.
