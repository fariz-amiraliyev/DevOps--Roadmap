Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides highly durable, secure,
fault-tolerant data storage.
AWS is responsible for maintaining availability and fault-tolerance;
you simply pay for the storage that you use.
Data is stored as objects within resources called buckets and a
single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size.
