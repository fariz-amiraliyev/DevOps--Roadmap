We can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and store metrics on a durable
platform that is separate and independent from your own infrastructure.
You can use these metrics to measure the performance and response times and also
capture custom metrics for your applications.
These metrics that can be used to do additional actions such as trigger
Auto Scaling, Notification, Fanout, trigger automated tasks, etc.
