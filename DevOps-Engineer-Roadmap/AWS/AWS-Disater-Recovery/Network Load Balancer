Network Load Balancer
Routes and load balances at the transport layer (TCP/UDP Layer-4), based on
address information extracted from the TCP packet header, not from packet content.
Network Load Balancers can handle traffic bursts, retain the source IP of the client,
and use a fixed IP for the life of the load balancer.
The Network Load Balancer target groups must have a target type of instance.
