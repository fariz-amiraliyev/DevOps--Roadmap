An immutable environment is a type of infrastructure in which resources (that is, servers) are never
modified once they have been deployed.

Typically, these servers are built from a common image (such as
an Amazon Machine Image). The benefit of this type of environment is increased reliability, consistency
and a more predictable environment.

In AWS, this can be achieved by creating the infrastructure using
AWS CloudFormation or AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) (CDK).
