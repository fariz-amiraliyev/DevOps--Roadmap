An Elastic IP address is a static, public, IPv4 address allocated to your AWS account. With an Elastic IP
address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another
instance in your account. Elastic IPs do not change and remain allocated to your account until you delete
them.
Elastic IP addresses are one method for handling failover, especially for legacy type applications that
cannot be scaled horizontally. In the event of a failure of a single server with an associated Elastic IP
address, the failover mechanism can re-associate the Elastic IP address to a replacement instance, ideally
in an automated fashion. While this scenario may experience downtime for the application, the time may
be limited to the time it takes to detect the failure and quickly re-associate the Elastic IP address to the
replacement resource.
