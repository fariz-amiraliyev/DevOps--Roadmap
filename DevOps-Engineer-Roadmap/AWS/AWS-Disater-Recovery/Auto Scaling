An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical
grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. In the context of a highly available
solution, using an Auto Scaling group ensures that an EC2 fleet provides the required capacity. The
continuous monitoring of the fleet instance health metrics allows for failures to be automatically
detected and for replacement instances to be launched when required.
The requirements of your application and high availability (HA) strategy determines the number of Auto
Scaling groups needed.
For an application that uses EC2 capacity spread across one or more Availability
Zones (AZ) then a single Auto Scaling group suffices.

Capacity launches where available and the Auto Scaling group replaces instances as
required; but the placement within selected AZs is arbitrary.

If the HA strategy requires more precise control of the distribution of EC2 capacity deployments, then using an
Auto Scaling group per AZ is the appropriate solution. An example is an application with two instances
—production and fail-over—that needs to be deployed in separate Availability Zones. Using two Auto
Scaling groups to manage the capacity of each application instance separately ensures that they do not
both have capacity in the same Availability Zone.
