Amazon EBS volumes are highly reliable, but to further mitigate the possibility of a failure, backups of
these volumes can be created using a feature called snapshots. A robust backup strategy will include an
interval (time between backups, generally daily but perhaps more frequently for certain applications),
a retention period (dependent on the application and the business requirements for rollback), and a
recovery plan. To ensure high durability for backups of EBS volumes, snapshots are stored in Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
EBS snapshots are used to create new Amazon EBS volumes, which are an exact replica of the original
volume at the time the snapshot was taken.
EBS snapshots are created and managed using the API, AWS Management Console, Amazon Data
Lifecycle Manager (DLM), or AWS Backup.
