Elastic Load Balancing is an AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions, and
ensures only healthy targets receive traffic. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a
single Availability Zone or across multiple AZs, and supports the ability to load balance across AWS and
on-premises resources in the same load balancer.
Application Load Balancer:
The Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides
advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including
microservices and containers. Operating at the individual request level (Layer 7), the Application Load
Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on the
content of the request.
Network Load Balancer:
Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic where extreme performance is
required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets
within Amazon VPC and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultralow
latencies. Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.
