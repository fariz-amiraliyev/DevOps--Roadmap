Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond
performance at any scale.
Amazon DynamoDB is purpose-built for mission-critical workloads. DynamoDB helps secure your data
with encryption at rest by default and continuously backs up your data for protection, with guaranteed
reliability through a service level agreement. Point-in-time recovery (PITR) helps protect DynamoDB
tables from accidental write or delete operations. PITR provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB
table data, and you can restore that table to any point in time up to the second during the preceding 35
days.
With Amazon DynamoDB, there are no servers to provision, patch, or manage, and no software to
install, maintain, or operate. DynamoDB automatically scales tables to adjust for capacity and maintains
performance with zero administration. Availability and fault tolerance are built in, eliminating the need
to architect your applications for these capabilities.
