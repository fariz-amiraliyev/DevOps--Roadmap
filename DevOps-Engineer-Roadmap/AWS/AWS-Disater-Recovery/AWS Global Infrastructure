1. AWS Regions and Availability Zones
An AWS Region is a geographical area of the world. Each AWS Region is a collection of data centers
that are logically grouped into what we call Availability Zones.
2. High Availability Through Multiple Availability Zones
3. You can achieve high availability by deploying your applications to span across multiple Availability
Zones. For each application tier (that is, web, application, and database), placing multiple, redundant
instances in distinct AZs creates a multi-site solution. Using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), you get
improved fault tolerance as the ELB service automatically balances traffic across multiple instances in
multiple Availability Zones, ensuring that only healthy instances receive traffic. The desired goal is to
have an independent copy of each application stack in two or more AZs, with automated traffic routing
to healthy resources.
