Continuous delivery is a release practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production.
AWS CloudFormation and CodePipeline, use continuous delivery to automatically build and test changes to AWS CloudFormation templates
before promoting them to production stacks. This release process lets rapidly and reliably make changes to AWS infrastructure.
Use CodePipeline to build a continuous delivery workflow by building a pipeline for AWS CloudFormation stacks. CodePipeline has built-in
integration with AWS CloudFormation, so  can specify AWS CloudFormation-specific actions, such as creating, updating, or
deleting a stack, within a pipeline.
