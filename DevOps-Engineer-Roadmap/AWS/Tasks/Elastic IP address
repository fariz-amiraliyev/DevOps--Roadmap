Allocate an Elastic IP address from a public IPv4 address pool, or use global IP addresses
from AWS Global Accelerator. You can have one Elastic IP associated with a running instance at
 no charge. Youâ€™re charged for additional Elastic IPs that are associated with the instance,
 Elastic IPs that are associated with stopped instances or unattached network interfaces,
 and unassociated Elastic IPs

An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
 By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software
 by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.
 An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it.


 To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account,
 and then associate it with your instance or a network interface.

 When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance,
 it is also associated with the instance's primary network interface.

When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or its primary network
interface, the instance's public IPv4 address (if it had one) is released back
into Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses. You cannot reuse a public
IPv4 address, and you cannot convert a public IPv4 address to an Elastic IP address.


You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from a resource, and then associate
it with a different resource. To avoid unexpected behavior, ensure that all active
connections to the resource named in the existing association are closed before you
make the change. After you have associated your Elastic IP address to a different resource,
you can reopen your connections to the newly associated resource.

When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that previously had a public IPv4 address,
the public DNS host name of the instance changes to match the Elastic IP address.
