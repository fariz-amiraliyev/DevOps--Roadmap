Iâ€™ll show you a modernized solution to centralize DNS management in
a multi-account environment by using Route 53 Resolver. This solution
allows you to resolve domains across multiple accounts and between workloads running on
AWS and on-premises without the need to run a domain controller in AWS.


My solution will show you how to solve three primary use-cases for domain resolution:

Resolving on-premises domains from workloads running in your VPCs.
Resolving private domains in your AWS environment from workloads running on-premises.
Resolving private domains between workloads running in different AWS accounts.
The following diagram explains the high-level full architecture.
