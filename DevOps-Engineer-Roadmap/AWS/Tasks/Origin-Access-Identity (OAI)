Overview of OAI Setup
When you first set up an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for a
CloudFront distribution, you grant everyone permission to read the files in your bucket.
This allows anyone to access your files either through CloudFront or using the Amazon S3 URL.

If you use CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to files
in your Amazon S3 bucket, you probably also want to prevent users from accessing
your Amazon S3 files by using Amazon S3 URLs. If users access your files directly in
Amazon S3, they bypass the controls provided by CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.
This includes control over the date and time that a user can no longer access your content,
nd control over which IP addresses can be used to access content. In addition, if users access
files both through CloudFront and directly by using Amazon S3 URLs, CloudFront access logs
 are less useful because they're incomplete.

Important 2 steps:
 1. Creating a CloudFront OAI and Adding it to Your Distribution
 2. Granting the OAI Permission to Read Files in Your Amazon S3 Bucket
