Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that provides savings of up to 72% on your AWS compute usage.
This pricing model offers lower prices on Amazon EC2 instances usage, regardless of instance family, size,
 OS, tenancy or AWS Region, and also applies to AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda usage.

Savings Plans offer significant savings over On Demand, just like EC2 Reserved Instances, in exchange
for a commitment to use a specific amount of compute power (measured in $/hour) for a one or three year period.
You can sign up for Savings Plans for a 1- or 3-year term and easily manage your plans by taking advantage of
recommendations, performance reporting and budget alerts in the AWS Cost Explorer.
