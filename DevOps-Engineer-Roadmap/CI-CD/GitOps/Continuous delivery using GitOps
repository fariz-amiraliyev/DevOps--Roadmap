GitOps is a term coined by WeaveWorks and is a way to do Kubernetes cluster
management and continuous delivery. In this approach, a Git repository
is designated as the single source of truth for deployment artifacts,
such as YAML files, that provide a declarative way to describe the cluster state.
As illustrated in the architecture below, a Weave Flux agent runs in the Kubernetes
cluster and watches the Git repository and image registries, such as Amazon Elastic
Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and Docker Hub, where the container images pertaining
to application workloads reside. If changes to deployment artifacts are pushed to this
config repository or a new image is pushed to the image registry by a continuous integration
system such as Jenkins, the Weave Flux agent responds by pulling these changes down and updating
the relevant applications workloads deployed to the cluster.
