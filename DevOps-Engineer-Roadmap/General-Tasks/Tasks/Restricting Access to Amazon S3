Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity.
Create a special CloudFront user called an origin access identity (OAI) and associate it with your distribution.

Configure your S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your
bucket and serve them to your users. Make sure that users canâ€™t use a direct URL to the S3 bucket to access a file there.
