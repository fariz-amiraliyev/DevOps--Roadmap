Capacity Reservation requests are granted or denied based on your EC2 instance limits and our available capacity.
When you create a Capacity Reservation, we reserve the specified capacity for your use.
The reserved capacity is charged at the selected instance typeâ€™s On-Demand rate whether an instance is running
in it or not. You can also use your regional reserved instances with your Capacity Reservations to benefit from billing discounts.
