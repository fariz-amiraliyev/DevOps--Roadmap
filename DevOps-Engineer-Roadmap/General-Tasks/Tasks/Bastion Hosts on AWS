Use this Quick Start to set up the following networking environment on AWS:

A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices,
to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
An internet gateway to allow access to the internet. This gateway is used by the bastion
hosts to send and receive traffic.*
Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
A Linux bastion host in each public subnet with an Elastic IP address to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH)
access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.
A security group for fine-grained inbound access control.
An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a configurable number of instances.
A set of Elastic IP addresses that match the number of bastion host instances.
If the Auto Scaling group relaunches any instances, these addresses
are reassociated with the new instances.
An Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group to hold the Linux bastion host shell history logs.
