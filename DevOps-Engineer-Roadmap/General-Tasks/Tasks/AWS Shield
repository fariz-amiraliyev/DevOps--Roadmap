AWS provides AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced for protection against DDoS attacks.
AWS Shield Standard is automatically included at no extra cost beyond what you already pay for
AWS WAF and your other AWS services. For added protection against DDoS attacks, AWS offers
AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack
protection for your resources.

You can add protection for any of the following resource types:

Amazon CloudFront distributions

Amazon Route 53 hosted zones

AWS Global Accelerator accelerators

Application load balancers

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Elastic IP addresses

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple
compromised systems attempt to flood a target, such as a network or web application, with traffic.
A DDoS attack can prevent legitimate users from accessing a service and can cause the system to
crash due to the overwhelming traffic volume.
AWS provides two levels of protection against DDoS attacks: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.
