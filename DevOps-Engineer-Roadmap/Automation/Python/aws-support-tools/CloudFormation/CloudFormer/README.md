# CloudFormer Implementation for Existing VPCs

This version of the [CloudFormer solution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cloudformer.html) can be used to launch the solution into an existing VPC.

This version replaces the "VPCSelection" parameter with two new parameters "VpcId" and "SubnetId".

[AWS-specific parameter types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-specific-parameter-types) "AWS::EC2::VPC::Id" and "AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id" have been used to populate selections based on resources available in the account. The subnet selected MUST be a public subnet with an Internet Gateway. Selecting a private subnet that uses a NAT Gateway will not work.
