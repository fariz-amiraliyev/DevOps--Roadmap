Responding to Invalid SSH Logins:

Scenario:  an EC2 instance is experiencing multiple failed SSH logins, and we want to automatically take the instance
offline in response to this potential security event.

We use the Web Server Log Group and the Invalid SSH Login metric filter to trigger a
CloudWatch alarm set for 2 data points within 1 minute.
This alarm should publish to an alarm notification SNS topic and
send you an email as well as trigger the Lambda function to stop the instance.

Configure CloudWatch metrics on EC2 instance:

1. The EC2 instance must have an IAM role that can communicate with both CloudWatch and Systems Manager.
Create an IAM Instance Role
Select IAM > Create Role > AWS Service > EC2 > Next: Permissions.
Select the CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy managed policy.
Select the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore managed policy.
Name the role "CloudWatchAgentAdminRole".
2. Attach the IAM Role to the Instance


3. Install CloudWatch Agent using Systems Manager
Run command: AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage
Action: Install
Name: AmazonCloudWatchAgent

4. Configure the CloudWatch Agent
Run the CloudWatch Agent Configuration Wizard.
Create a new session using SSM Session Manager.
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
Note: Do not select CollectD, unless you already installed it using sudo yum install collectd.
Specify /var/log/secure at the "Do you want to monitor any log files?" prompt.
Validate the Configuration
```sh
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s

Create an SNS Topic
Create an SNS Topic
The CloudWatch Alarm will notify this topic, and the topic will trigger the Lambda function.
Topic name: AlarmNotificationTopic

4. Configure the CloudWatch Alarm
Add a Metric Filter to the Web Server Log Group
Click Secure log group.
Click Create metric filter.
Filter pattern: [Mon, day, timestamp, ip, id, status = Invalid*]
Click Test pattern.
Click Assign metric.
Filter name: InvalidSSHLogin
Metric namespace: SSH
Metric name: InvalidSSHLogin
Create Alarm
Metric filter: SSH/InvalidSSHLogin
Click Create alarm.

Name: InvalidSSHLoginAlarm
Description: Invalid login attempts >2 in 1 min for instance <append instance ID>
Note: The description is critical, as the instance ID at the end is used by the Lambda function to stop the instance.

Whenever InvalidSSHLogin >= 2 for 1 out of 1 datapoints

Subscribe to the SNS Topic
Select AlarmNotificationTopic and click Create alarm.

Create IAM Role for Lambda Function
Create the role LambdaStopInstances using policy lambda_execution_role.json.
Create Lambda function
Name: StopInstance
Role: StopInstancesRole
Trigger Lambda from SNS
Select Trigger > SNS > AlarmNotificationTopic.
Trigger the CloudWatch Alarm
Make 3 invalid SSH login attempts within 2 minutes.
Verify that the secure log contains the Invalid user string.
Verify that the CloudWatch alarm is set.
Verify that the CloudWatch Log for the Lambda function ran.
Verify that the EC2 instance is stopped.
