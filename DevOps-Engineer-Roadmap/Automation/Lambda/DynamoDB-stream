Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that can create triggersâ€”pieces
of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers,
can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.

If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) with an AWS Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the
table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream. AWS Lambda polls the
stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it detects new stream records.

Step 1: Create a DynamoDB Table with a Stream Enabled
Step 2: Create a Lambda Execution Role
Step 3: Create an Amazon SNS Topic
Step 4: Create and Test a Lambda Function
Step 5: Create and Test a Trigger

How it works ?
1. A user writes an item to a DynamoDB table (BarkTable). Each item in the table represents a bark.

2. A new stream record is written to reflect that a new item has been added to BarkTable.

3. The new stream record triggers an AWS Lambda function (publishNewBark).

4. If the stream record indicates that a new item was added to BarkTable,
   the Lambda function reads the data from the stream record and publishes a
    message to a topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

5. The message is received by subscribers to the Amazon SNS topic. (In this tutorial,
   the only subscriber is an email address.)
