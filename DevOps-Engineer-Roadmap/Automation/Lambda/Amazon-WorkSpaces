Automate provisioning of Amazon WorkSpaces using AWS Lambda:

By creating a Lambda function with VPC access, we can use the Python library
LDAP3 to connect to directory services. Using a simple LDAPS search, we can get a
list of members in a directory group. Then using the Python Boto3 library to
access the WorkSpaces API, we can compare the directory group members to current
WorkSpaces users. Finally, we create WorkSpaces for group members who do not have one,
and terminate WorkSpaces for users no longer in the group.

In this walkthrough you will complete the following tasks:

Store domain service account password in AWS Secrets Manager.
Create an IAM Policy and Role for the AWS Lambda function.
Create an AWS Security Group to allow the Lambda function to connect to LDAPS.
Create zip file with Lambda code and dependencies.
Create a Lambda function.
Create CloudWatch Events Rule to run the Lambda function on a schedule.
