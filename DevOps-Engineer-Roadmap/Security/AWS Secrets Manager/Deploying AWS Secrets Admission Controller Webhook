AWS Secrets Admission Controller can be deployed via a Helm chart. The Helm chart creates
the following Kubernetes objects:

A Kubernetes deployment running the admission controller.
A Kubernetes service that exposes the above deployment.
A Kubernetes secret that contains the TLS certificates for the admission controller.
A MutatingWebhookConfiguration object.
If you need instructions on how to install Helm, please refer the official Helm documentation here.

1. Add the Helm repository that contains the Helm charts for the secret-inject admission controller webhook.

$ helm repo add secret-inject https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-secret-sidecar-injector/
Bash

2. Chart repositories change frequently due to updates and new additions. To keep Helmâ€™s local
list updated with all these changes, we need to occasionally run the repository update command.

$ helm repo update
Bash
3. Install the AWS Secret Controller by installing the Helm chart.

$ helm install secret-inject secret-inject/secret-inject
Bash
4. Verify that the relevant Kubernetes objects were created.


$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration
