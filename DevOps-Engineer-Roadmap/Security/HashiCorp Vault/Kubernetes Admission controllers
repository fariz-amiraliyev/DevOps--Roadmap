The Vault Helm chart can also optionally install the Vault Agent Sidecar Injector.
The Vault Agent Sidecar Injector alters pod specifications to include Vault Agent
containers that render Vault secrets to a shared memory volume using Vault Agent
Templates. By rendering secrets to a shared volume, containers within the pod can
consume Vault secrets without being Vault aware.

The injector is a Kubernetes Mutation Webhook Controller. The controller
intercepts pod events and applies mutations to the pod if annotations exist
within the request. This functionality is provided by the vault-k8s project
and can be automatically installed and configured using the Vault Helm chart.
