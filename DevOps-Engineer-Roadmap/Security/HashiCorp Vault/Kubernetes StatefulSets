In Kubernetes, there are multiple types of workload controller primitives and one
of which is the StatefulSet. The StatefulSet, typically used to manage stateful
applications, manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides
 guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment,
 a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec, but
 unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods.
 These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent
 identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

The Vault Helm Chart uses the StatefulSet deployment model. Although individual
Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers
make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that
have failed.
