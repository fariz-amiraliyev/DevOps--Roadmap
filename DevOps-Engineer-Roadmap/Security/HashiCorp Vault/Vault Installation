Consul is a service mesh solution that launches with a key-value store. Vault requires a
storage backend like Consul to manage its configuration and secrets when it is run in high-availability.

The recommended way to run Consul on Kubernetes is via the Helm chart. Helm is a
package manager that installs and configures all the necessary components to run
Consul in several different modes. A Helm chart includes templates that enable conditional
and parameterized execution. These parameters can be set through command-line arguments
or defined in YAML.
