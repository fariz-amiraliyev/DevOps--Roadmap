For a production-ready install, we suggest that the Vault Helm chart is installed
in high availability (HA) mode. This installs a StatefulSet of Vault server Pods
with either Integrated Storage, or a Consul storage backend. The Vault Helm chart,
however, can also configure Vault to run in dev, or standalone mode.


Historically, customers have addressed the shortcomings of Kubernetes Secrets by
using an external secret provider like Hashicorpâ€™s Vault, which supports both
granular permissions and the automatic rotation of secrets. It also integrates
with Kubernetes by way of Kubernetes Service Accounts and mutating webhooks.
The Service Account assigns an identity to a pod, which is used to grant access
to secrets in Vault whereas the webhook is used to inject an init container
into a Pod that mounts the Secret from Vault to a temporary volume. Together,
these make it easier to consume Vault secrets from within Kubernetes.
