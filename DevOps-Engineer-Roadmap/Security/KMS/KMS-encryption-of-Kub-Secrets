Recently, EKS added support for KMS envelope encryption of Kubernetes Secrets.
With envelope encryption, you can use a customer-managed AWS KMS key to encrypt
the data key Kubernetes uses to encrypt secrets. This allows you to strengthen
your overall security posture because it creates a dependence on a separate key
that is stored outside of Kubernetes. This is in addition to the full volume encryption
that AWS already uses to protect data persisted to etcd. For further information about
data encryption for Kubernetes Secrets works, please visit the encrypt data documentation.

Although envelope encryption makes Kubernetes Secrets a viable option for storing secret material,
there are still a couple of downsides. First, Kubernetes Pods and Secrets are scoped to a namespace.
If pods and secrets share a namespace, pods can read all of the secrets created in that namespace.
Second, Kubernetes secrets are not rotated automatically. If you need/want to rotate a secret periodically,
you have to do so manually.
