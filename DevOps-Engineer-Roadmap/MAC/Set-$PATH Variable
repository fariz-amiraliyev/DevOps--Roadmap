Method #1: $HOME/.bash_profile file
The syntax is as follows:

export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir/location1
export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir1:/dir2:/dir/path/no3
In this example, add /usr/local/sbin/modemZapp/ directory to $PATH variable. Edit the file $HOME/.bash_profile, enter:
vi $HOME/.bash_profile

OR
vi ~/.bash_profile

Append the following export command:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin/modemZapp
Save and close the file. To apply changes immedialty enter:
source $HOME/.bash_profile

OR
. $HOME/.bash_profile

Finally, verify your new path settings, enter:
echo $PATH

Method #2: /etc/paths.d directory
Apple recommends the path_helper tool to generate the PATH variable i.e. helper for constructing PATH environment variable. From the man page:

The path_helper utility reads the contents of the files in the directories /etc/paths.d and /etc/manpaths.d and appends their contents to the PATH and MANPATH environment variables respectively.

(The MANPATH environment variable will not be modified unless it is already set in the environment.)

Files in these directories should contain one path element per line.

Prior to reading these directories, default PATH and MANPATH values are obtained from the files /etc/paths and /etc/manpaths respectively.

To list existing path, enter:
ls -l /etc/paths.d/
